# CoinsCounterMXN
This notebook is an example of mexican coins' counter using OpenCV at Google Colab.

This is just an example, it works only for the imagen example, but we must consider the all of factors to improve our results, in this case, I used mexican coins like example of the counter script at Google Colab.
